# Style Guide

## Branch Naming Convention

Branch names must follow the pattern `ABC-123-brief-description-in-kebab-case`

- Start with ticket number, e.g. `ABC-123`
- Followed by a `-`
- Followed by a kebab-case string

### Examples

```shell
# ❌ BAD
fix(abc-123)-issue
abc-123-Fix-Issue
ABC-SomeNewFeature

# ✅ GOOD
ABC-123-fix-issue
ABC-123-add-new-feature
ABC-123-update-readme
```
